                        My name is Indima Dias. Originally from a tiny island called Sri Lanka and living in USA today. That’s me in the picture 23 years ago, when I was dreaming to become a Doctor but ended up being a software engineer. 
                        I entered the path of computer science when I even did not know how to use a computer. But I took the challenge and achieved my goal. Programming 
                        became my favorite subject. I believe I can adapt to any new environment and take new challengers. I believe I am a good mom, a loving wife, a great daughter and sister and a friend that friends can count on.

                    <p>
                        I am so blessed with a loving husband and two adorable challenging kids. I became SAHM after my daughter was born. 
                        I love arts and crafts. So I used the opportunity of being at home to improve my arts and crafts skills.
                        My favorite hobby is making little girls’ cloths. Apart from that I love crochet, making felt ornaments and reading.  
                        And I love to volunteer at school projects.

                        I enjoy coding and I enjoy learning new programming languages. Apart from being a mother I realized that I should be a role model to my daughter.
                        So I decided to start where I stopped in my carrier. My next goal is to achieve the best in full stack programming and make a web site to help my kids learn my mother language “Sinhala”
